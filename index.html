    <h1>Hello Microverse!</h1>
    <h3> Day 1 of Microverse </h3>
    <p> My day started with a welcome call, it lasted one hour and had useful information. Then we join programming time zoom call with my coding partner Moses who is very clever and friendly.</p>
    <p> Then I set up git and vscode. The day ended well with a standup, since I made new friends and we cheered each other up.</p>
